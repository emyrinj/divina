          The name <strong className="italic">“Divina”</strong> comes from the Italian word for “divine” or “perfect,” reflecting the essence we strive to embody in each of our designs.
          Every piece in our portfolio is crafted to celebrate subtle sophistication — effortlessly wearable, yet distinctly refined.
